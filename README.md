# TODO


## MUST DO:
- sound
- better end screen
    - Fireworks? Fancy text?
- more levels
- title art
    - make it wobble or something.

- itch page etc.

## WANT TO DO
- speedrun timer
- text between levels?

## Level Ideas
- One where level exit is only visible in inaccessible areas
    - need to deduce its path and intercept it when not visible.
    - probably need a path of mines as hints.
- Opposite-direction versions of existing levels
    - probably easier than the current version.
- Dense maze where enemy starts close to you.
- Other radar scan shapes?
- moving mine configurations?
    - maybe one that tracks alongside the radar scanline?
- confusing not-you green arrows?
    - easy-to-implement version: just make them follow some out-of-sync paths
    - hard version: they move randomly, you are also placed randomly.

# Sound
- movement noise
- death noise
- radar ping
- exit noise
- enemy approaching noise?
- music?


## Bug Fixes
- particles cancelled by radar when exiting level?

## Stretch Goals/nice-to-have
- Mine particles?
- background shader?
- Music?
- Finally settle on a good palette.
