# TODO


## Level Ideas
- One where level exit is only visible in inaccessible areas
    - need to deduce its path and intercept it when not visible.
    - probably need a path of mines as hints.
- Opposite-direction versions of existing levels
    - probably easier than the current version.
- Dense maze where enemy starts close to you.
- Other radar scan shapes?
- moving mine configurations?
    - maybe one that tracks alongside the radar scanline?
- confusing not-you green arrows?
    - easy-to-implement version: just make them follow some out-of-sync paths
    - hard version: they move randomly, you are also placed randomly.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Speedrun timer?
    - something to make player move and not just sit in one place.

# Sound
- movement noise
- death noise
- radar ping
- exit noise
- enemy approaching noise?
- music?

## Polish
- pick palette
- Menu
    - font etc.
    - instructions
- bloom/postprocessing
    - background shader?


## Bug Fixes
- particles cancelled by radar when exiting level?

## Stretch Goals/nice-to-have
- Mine particles?
- Branching narrative between levels?
    - gives more choices for speedrunners?
- Endless mode?
- Music?
