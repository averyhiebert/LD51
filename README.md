# TODO


## Level Ideas
- One where level exit is only visible in inaccessible areas
    - need to deduce its path and intercept it when not visible.
    - probably need a path of mines as hints.
- Opposite-direction versions of existing levels
    - probably easier than the current version.
- Other radar scan shapes?
- moving mine configurations?
    - maybe one that tracks alongside the radar scanline?

## Gameplay
- More levels
- enemy that follows you
    - should always point towards you (extra information for player)
- confusing not-you green arrows?
    - easy-to-implement version: just make them follow some out-of-sync paths
    - hard version: they move randomly, you are also placed randomly.
- Speedrun timer?
    - something to make player move and not just sit in one place.

# Sound
- movement noise
- death noise
- radar ping
- exit noise
- enemy approaching noise?
- music?

## Polish
- pick palette
- Menu
    - font etc.
    - instructions
- Mine particles?
- bloom/postprocessing
    - background shader?

## Bug Fixes
- particles cancelled by radar when exiting level?

## Stretch Goals
- Branching narrative between levels?
    - gives more choices for speedrunners?
- Endless mode?
