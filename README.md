# TODO

## Gameplay
- design some levels
- enemy that follows you
    - should always point towards you (extra information for player)
- moving exits
    - moving counterclockwise through quadrants, synced with radar
        - (e.g. 90 degrees ccw for each 270 degrees cw of the radar)
- confusing not-you green arrows?
- moving mine configurations?
- Timer?
    - something to make player move and not just sit in one place.

# Sound
- movement noise
- death noise
- radar ping
- exit noise
- enemy approaching noise?
- music?

# graphics
- pick palette
- bloom/postprocessing
- font etc.

## Polish
- Proper feedback for death/next level
    - particles
    - make whatever killed you visible
- Menu
    - instructions

## Stretch Goals
- Branching narrative between levels?
- Endless mode?
