# Radar Rider: Radars of the Lost Dark

Guide a spaceship to safety with the aid of a very slowly updating radar display.  A game made in 45-ish hours as a submission to both the 51st Ludum Dare game jam (Compo) and the Fall 2022 Waterloo Game Jam.  You can play it online [here](https://averyhiebert.itch.io/radar-rider).

## Instructions

Use WASD or arrow keys to move.

Try to get to the stargate.  Don't touch the red spikey things.  Pretty self-explanatory.

## Theme

The Ludum Dare theme was "Every 10 seconds."  The radar sweeps a full circle once every 10 seconds.  Thus, each part of the screen is also visible once every 10 seconds.

The Waterloo Game Jam theme was "Far from Close."  Radar maps nearby objects by measuring how far away they are (i.e. it distinguishes far objects from close ones).
